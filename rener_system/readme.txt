Due to large file constraints on github you should download the model.bin files from drive. 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1svpNnEhyZWaieXAKee3YP2dtCNkqykaF?usp=sharing

Place them into the following folders:

abstracion_extraction/transformer/model/ (this is for the abstraction extraction model)

relation_extraction/training/model-best/transformer/model/ (this is for the relation extraction model)
